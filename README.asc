Overview
========
Adds ActiveRecord callbacks for create, update and delete that will signal Binnacle
with the state of the object (to_json)

Setup
=====
Add the binnacle_ar gem to your Gemfile:

```
gem 'binnacle_ar'
```

Configure Binnacle Ruby driver by providing the values for endpoint, target context and
a valid publisher's api key and secret:

```
BINNACLE_ENDPOINT=localhost
BINNACLE_AR_CTX=26e5z3cybiv5tqj12zy6
BINNACLE_API_KEY=nmp9wnfoj1t10spzi57r
BINNACLE_API_SECRET=xsh3lanzk4oaqxcvho7d
```

Usage
=====
Use the `binnacle_signal` class method on an ActiveRecord model to decide on
which actions to signal Binnacle:

```
class Comment < ActiveRecord::Base
  binnacle_signal :on => [:create, :update, :destroy]
end
```
